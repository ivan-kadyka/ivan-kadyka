## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have over 10 years of experience in software development, with most of my expertise concentrated on desktop or game applications using C#/.NET,
WPF, and Unity technologies. I have developed various aspects, including game applications, custom game engines and editors, core infrastructure solutions, and pipelines.
