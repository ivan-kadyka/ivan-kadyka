## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have over 10 years of software development experience, specializing in desktop applications with C#/.NET and WPF, game development using Unity and Xamarin, and web applications with ASP.NET Core, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Next.js. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have expertise in developing a wide range of solutions, including game applications, custom game engines and editors, core infrastructure systems, and pipelines. I am experienced in leading projects through the complete application lifecycleâ€”from initial concept to final product deliveryâ€”covering feature design, development, testing, deployment, support, analytics, and comprehensive documentation.
